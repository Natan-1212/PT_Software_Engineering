///Discuss - Why do you think Heinz made this change?

/*user experience (UX) refers to any interaction a user has with a product or service.
 UX design considers each and every element that shapes this experience, 
 how it makes the user feel, and how easy it is for the user to accomplish their
  desired tasks. UI design is the look and feel, the presentation and 
  the interactivity of a product. When Heinz made changes on the tomato ketchup bottles, 
  the updated one appears easy to handle, user friendly and easier to put it upside down 
  so that it will be convenient to add the katchup whereever the customer needs and it 
  seems in line with the concepts of UX/UI Design in web developmet */


  //Discuss - How does this apply to web development?

  /*Watching the Super Mario game helps me to understand that the UX skills learned from 
  the game are crucial to design patterns, flows, information structures, and 
  user observation skills to tackle UX/UI challenges arising between developers
   and other user's successfull experiences. */

///A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it's not that good.
/*When someone tells you a joke, they are expecting a laugh from you. And it feels odd if you don’t 
understand the joke and no response comes from your side.
The person who is telling the joke has to explain it, and the situation no longer remains humorous.
Similarly in case of  user interface, when a user comes to your product, they should be able to 
find the possible actions they can perform with the design. A design should be self-explanatory and 
understandable for the user by making ease of use its priority. 
Ease of use is the top most important feature frustrates users when missing. Hence, a good joke 
and UI needs to be simple , self-explanatory and understandable for the audiences and users
in order to get the maximum output.*/

/*In the vedio Dan Norman explained that a good and Human-centred design door incorrporates 
fundamental principles; 
*Discoverability- the user cannot find it, it does not exist. It must be made clear as a bell 
what actions are possible in a UI in less than a microsecond — for example, labeling icons as a best practice.

*Feedback- It means that constant visibility of system status, i.e., the system should make sure that: 
users are kept informed about what’s going on and there is continuous information about the results of 
their actions and the current state of the product (system). Users has to be updated and 
there should not be a gap of information (UX/UI should also take this tenet under cosideration )

*Affordances- an object’s affordance is not determined solely by design but by the way a user interacts with it. 
An object’s affordance is determined by user interaction and it has to be user friendly. */

////What's a site that you use all the time that has good UX? Facebook 

/*How is that site:

*Goal Focused:goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, 
in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design). Facebook also meets 
this criteria and my interaction with the cite is simple and efficient whenever i try to access the 
website 

*Invisible-An invisible UI is when the user experience of a feature is so intuitive that a UI isn’t really required 
(like Smart Guides in Photoshop, Adobe XD and Sketch — they appear automatically when you move a layer, to help you align it).

*Forgiving-the designs of Facebook also helps people avoid errors and protect them from harm if errors occur.This 
is done by providing confimations and warnings whenever one tries to share a post 
or pictures on Facebook

*Consistent-consistency is the thread that ties together elements in a single design. The 
design Facebook website has since its inception has relatively the same kind of buttons
and locations of the buttons to share , like , post messages.

Smooth Onboarding- onboarding experience is a way to introduce users to a new product, app, or feature. 
Onboarding UX is the design of a flow or series of flows that give the user a guided introduction to the product, 
set up some initial preferences, or point out critical UI elements in an interface. Facebook also 
fulfills this criteria as a user friendly interface. */
